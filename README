NAME
    Class::Ref - Automatic OO wrapping of container references

SYNOPSIS
        $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => { bar => 'Hello World!' } });
        $o->foo->bar;    # returns "Hello World!"
        $o->baz({ blah => 123 });
        $o->baz->blah;    # returns 123

        $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => [{ bar => 'Hello Again!' }] });
        $o->foo->[0]->bar;    # returns "Hello Again!"

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Ref provides an OO wrapping layer around Hash and Array
    references. Part of the magic is that it does this deeply and across
    array/hash boundaries.

OPTIONS
    Some of the behavior of the encapsulation can be modified by the
    following options:

    $raw_access (Default: 0)
            $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => { bar => 1 } });
            {
                $Class::Ref::raw_access = 1;
                $o->foo;    # returns { bar => 1 }
            }

        Should you ever need to work with the raw contents of the data
        structure, setting $raw_access with cause every member retrieval to
        just the referenced data rather than a wrapped form of it.

        The observant reader will note that this does not provide access to
        the base data. In order to access that, you must dereference the
        object:

            $$o;    # returns { foo => { bar => 1 } } unblessed

        See GUTS for more information.

    $allow_undef (Default: 0)
            $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => { bar => 1 } });
            {
                local $Class::Ref::allow_undef = 1;
                $o->not_here;    # returns undef
            }
            $o->not_here;        # raises exception

        By default, an exception will be raised if you try to read from a
        HASH key that is non-existent.

METHODS
    There is only the constructor.

    new
            $o = Class::Ref->new({...});
            $o = Class::Ref->new([...]);

        Wrap the provided reference in OO getters and setters.

PHILOSOPHY
    A lot of effort has been made to ensure that the only code that changes
    your wrapped data is your code. There is no blessing of any of the data
    wrapped by Class::Ref.

    With that being said, the goal has been to reduce the syntax need to
    access values deep inside a HASH/ARRAY reference.

HASH Refs
    Wrapping a HASH is a fairly straightforward process. All keys of the
    hash will be made available as a method call.

    There is a bit more here however. If, for example, you accessed the
    actual hash, Class::Ref will still encapsulate the return value if that
    value is a HASH or an ARRAY:

        $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => { bar => 1 } });
        $o->{foo}->bar;    # works

    But all without modifying, blessing, or otherwise messing with the
    value. The data referenced with $o remains the same as when it
    originally wrapped.

ARRAY Refs
    Wrapping ARRAYs is much less straightforward. Using an "AUTOLOAD" method
    doesn't help because perl symbols cannot begin with a number. Makes it a
    little difficult to do the following:

        $o->0;    # compile error

    So for the purpose of this module, wrapped ARRAYs exactly like an ARRAY
    reference:

        $o->[0];    # ahh, much better

    The tricky part comes in wanting to make sure that values returned from
    such a call would still be wrapped:

        $o->[0]->foo;    # $o = [{ foo => 'bar' }]

    See GUTS for more discussion on how this is done.

    I am still debating if adding formal accessor methods would be helpful
    in this context.

GUTS
    All objects created and returned by Class::Ref are blessed REF types.
    This is what protects the original reference from being blessed into an
    unwanted package. The "ref" type of the given value is what determines
    what package the REF is blessed into. HASHes go into "Class::Ref::HASH"
    and ARRAYs go into "Class::Ref::ARRAY".

    The use of the overload pragma to overload the dereference operators
    allows the REF object to still be accessed as HASH refs and ARRAY refs.
    When these REFs are coerced into their appropriate type, they are
    wrapped in a tie mechanism to retain control over the return of member
    values.

    The only way to fully bypass all of this is to manually dereference the
    REF object:

        $o = Class::Ref->new({ foo => 1 });
        $$o->{foo};

CAVEATS
    When dealing with a wrapped HASH, there is no way to access keys named
    "isa" and "can". They are core methods perl uses to interact with OO
    values.

    Accessing HASH members with invalid perl symbols is possible with a
    little work:

        my $method = '0) key';
        $o->$method;    # access $o->{'0) key'};

SEE ALSO
    I've always wanted to have this kind of functionality for hashes that
    really needed a more formal interface. However, I found myself wanting
    more from the existing modules out there in the wild. So I borrowed some
    the great ideas out there and brewed my own implementation to have the
    level of flexibility that I desire. And if it helps others, that's
    awesome too.

    *   Class::Hash

        Probably the de facto module for creating accessors to a hash.
        However, it only provides a single layer of encapsulation.

    *   Class::ConfigHash

        Provides a deeper implementation but takes (avoids) steps to make
        the hash read-only.

    *   Hash::AsObject

        Also provides a deep implementation. Goes further to provide access
        to methods like "AUTOLOAD" and "DESTROY".
